# CI/CD Workflow Definitions
This directory contains CI/CD workflow definitions using [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/devops/pipelines/),
under ``devops-pipelines``. These workflows cover testing and deployment of both ML code (for model training, batch inference, etc) and the 
Databricks ML resource definitions under ``test_azure_devops_project/resources``. 

To set up CI/CD for a new project,
please refer to [ML resource config - set up CI CD](../../test_azure_devops_project/resources/README.md#set-up-ci-and-cd).
